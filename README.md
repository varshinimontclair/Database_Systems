In this project structure:
- The `Rebooters` directory is the root directory of your project.
- Inside `Rebooters`, there is a directory named `LLCTAX` which contains your Flask application.
  - `LLCTAX` has a `templates` directory for HTML templates (`index.html` and `taxtable.html`).
  - It also has a `static` directory for static assets like stylesheets (`style.css`).
- The main Flask application file (`llctax.py`) is in the root directory.
